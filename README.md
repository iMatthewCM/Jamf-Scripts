# Welcome

This is a collection of Scripts used to extend the functionality of Jamf Proâ€™s management capabilities.

These Scripts are **not official Jamf products** and are provided without warranty. Do **not** contact Jamf Support to ask for help using these Scripts as scripting is ***unsupported*** except as a paid engagement with Professional Services.

There are four categories of Scripts on this GitHub: API Scripts, macOS Scripts, Extension Attributes, and Snippets. Each category is in a directory named the same, and there is a README inside each directory detailing its contents.

***API Scripts*** can be run on anything that can run Bash. They do not need to be deployed to computers enrolled in Jamf Pro.

***macOS Scripts*** are written to be deployed via a Jamf Pro Policy to a macOS device.

***Extension Attributes*** are used to collect additional Inventory information for computers enrolled in Jamf Pro.

***Snippets*** are little pieces of code that might be useful to integrate into other projects. By themselves, they're usually pretty pointless.
